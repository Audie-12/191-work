# My Week
This week was a bit difficult to understand but once I got through all of the videos and the in class help I was able to put together something that I feel fits well. I experimented with the difference uses of blend modes and was able to create something that I at first didn't think I would be able to achieve. But looking at it now and going over the different ways you can do something can one find out how different even one change can be to the piece. That is something that I thought was really cool to learn within this project.
