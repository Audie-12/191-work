# Finally getting the hang of Things

This week I can say that I am following along pretty well with little to no questions about what is going on. One thing that I learned is that each triangle point had an X and Y coordinate that you put into the code to determine where it would go. So it was hard for me to figure out how the six different points worked but I figured it out finally! Then I originally tried to do an arc but could not figure it out, so going over it in class really helped me out. Although I am content with my little guy and do not want to add anything more to him. I am very excited to get into the animating portion of this class.
