# Problems
This was a difficult project to accomplish because nothing wanted to work for me. The images wouldn't load when I tried to put them in as the background. Then the sound did not want to work either. So I had to redo an entire set of code in one night. I got a decent amount accomplished but there is a lot more that I could have done or switched up to make it look more polished.

# Solutions
I talked to some of my friends who are in the second coding class and they helped me through some of it. But I still was unable to load any image or get sound even trying it on a Mac to see if the image would show up. But I didn't have any luck with that so I just had to deal with what I could do and went with that.
