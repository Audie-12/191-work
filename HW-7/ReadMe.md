# Unsure

This week I had a hard time trying to figure out how to remodel one of my codes because whenever I tried one thing it didn't seem to work properly so in the end I had to do this for mine instead. Which is still nice because I was able to use a function to put everything into one spot and then I could use just that name wherever in the code I chose to put it without have all of that writing in it as well. That way if I wanted to I could then develop a way to add more of them with just using the one word instead of re writing the entire code again.
