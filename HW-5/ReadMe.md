#Week 5
Once I started to actually play around with this a little more I actually started enjoying it more than I initially thought I would. Being able to control what goes on the screen and how you get from point a to point b is crazy. I am excited to see what else one can do with this!

##Helpful
I really enjoy the videos that are put up each week with the homework assignments because then if I forget something or I wasn't there one day I can go to those and get help that way if I can't get help before the due date.
